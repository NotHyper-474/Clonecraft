# Clonecraft
My attempt of recreating Minecraft with greedy meshing with Unity.  
Recommended Unity version is 2020 LTS.

#### Code based on:
[Greedy meshing algorithm](https://0fps.net/2012/06/30/meshing-in-a-minecraft-game)  
[Cleo Hayes' (formely Rob O'Leary) greedy mesh implementation](https://github.com/roboleary/GreedyMesh)

#
### TODO list (not necessarily in order)
- [X] Add greedy meshing
- [ ] Fix BlockPlacer
- [ ] Add proper texturing
- [ ] Cull chunk meshes
- [ ] Add menus and etc
- [ ] Clean code
